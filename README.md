## Description

This is a fictional pizzeria website developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
The main goal of this project is to demonstrate the layout of a pizza sales landing page, highlighting elements such as animations, interactive buttons and simple navigation.
The project is not functional for real orders and was developed as part of a personal study.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Basic page structure.

- **CSS3**: Visual styling and animations.

- **JavaScript**: Page interactivity.

- **Vercel**: Online application hosting.

## Features

**Landing Page**: Displays a layout with the pizzeria brand and background animations.

**Interactive Menu**: Shows a list of (fictional) pizzas with price and description.

**Order Button**: A stylized button with animation to indicate user interaction.

**Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes, providing a good experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Rotating Pizza Animation**: A continuous animation of a rotating pizza displayed at the center of the page.

## Color Documentation

**#FEF9EE**: Soft white, used as the main background color.

**#000000**: Black, used for texts and icons.

**#DB992C**: Yellow, used to highlight icons and elements such as the order button.

**#861B15**: Red, the main brand color of the pizzeria, used in the logo, order button and highlighted texts.

These colors were chosen to provide a warm and professional appearance, combining modern and traditional pizzeria design elements.

## Learnings

### During the development of this project, I learned several important techniques related to web design and functionality, including:

**CSS Animations**: How to apply and customize simple animations using @keyframes and the animation property.

**Responsiveness**: The importance of adapting layouts to different screen sizes using practices such as flexbox and relative units.

**JavaScript Interactivity**: How to implement simple interactions with JavaScript to improve user experience.

**Best Practices for Structure**: How to organize and structure a project clearly and efficiently, dividing it into components that make the code easier to maintain and understand.

## Future Improvements

- Add an online ordering section.

- Implement a pizza rating system.

- Improve accessibility with a stronger focus on WAI-ARIA.
